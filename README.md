# key-value-api
This repository contains a backend service (http API) which is developed with the help of "Python" and "Flask" by using "Redis" as a "In-memory key-value store". This repository also contains the "Dockerfile" which helps dockerizing the service. It also has "Manifest files of Kubernetes" which helps in deploying the docker image in Kubernetes. This project has been tested locally in "Minikube" cluster and everything works as expected.
